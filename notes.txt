NewOS kernel:
-------------
version:
-Forked from NewOS probably sometime in 2002.  Unclear when exactly.
-No NewOS version numbers, released as snapshots.

source (URL of original):
-Probably one of these: http://newos.org/snapshots/2002/

how old? how far behind latest stable release?
-Last NewOS snapshots were put out in 2005:
 http://newos.org/snapshots/
-So Haiku is ~3 years "behind" though the kernel was basically forked
 so not really.

how heavily modified?
-Very heavily modified.  Greping for copyrights of file headers
 gives..

why chosen for standard install?
-they needed a kernel and this one was out there

libc:
-----
version:

-hard to say, not a package per se but forked into the haiku
 repository as part of Haiku "libroot"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_C_Library

-initial import not visible in haiku repository, but subsequent
 commits indicated importing various files from the 2.3.x glibc
 releases

http://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/log/src/system/libroot/posix/glibc

source:
how old? how far behind latest stable release?

-well, the initial import is about a decade old but that may be
 deceptive but the commit logs indicated that some files from more
 recent releases have been imported along the way.

how heavily modified?
-quite heavily modified
-not tracking the upstream source
-replacing various functions from other sources entirely

http://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/log/src/system/libroot/posix/glibc

why chosen?
-in order to fulfil Haiku's goal of BeOS API compatibility, including
 c library functions in its libroot was a necessity
-using gnu libc as opposed to a bsd libc might have just been because
 beos used gnu libc in its libroot


bash:
-----
version: 4.0.35
source: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/
how old? how far behind latest stable release?
-Patch 35 for bash 4.0 was released on October 24th, 2009
-less than two years older than the latest patch 10 for bash 4.2, put
 out on May 3rd, 2011.

how heavily modified?

A recursive unified diff between the stock bash 4.0.35 and the one in
the haiku r1alpha3 sources produced 87 lines additions and 38 line
deletions.  Most of these changes appear to have to do with porting
the shell rather than modifying it.

why chosen?
-BeOS had a bash shell so it was necessary for Haiku to have one as
 well.

coreutils:
----------
version: 8.4
source: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/
how old? how far behind latest stable release?
Coreutils 8.4 was released January 13th, 2010 and the latest version
8.14 was released October 12th, 2011.

how heavily modified?

Of the new files added in the coreutils directory in the Haiku
sources, almost all were automatically generated, most likely during
the coreutils build process.  Changes to files in the Haiku sources
were limited to just 206 added or removed lines.  Among these changes,
the only significant modification has to do with adding support for
the copying of file metadata (attributes) which are a special feature
of the BeFS.

http://haiku-os.org/docs/userguide/en/attributes.html

why chosen?
-were chosen to support the command-line environment, including such
 basic commands as cat, cp, echo, ls, mv, mkdir, true, etc.

-Included version is from March 26th, 2002.  Latest release grep-2.9
 was put out June 21st, 2011.
how heavily modified?
-Source code diff shows it's virtually unchanged, mostly just a few
 ifdef's added for HAIKU.
why chosen?
-needed for a decent command-line interface

webpositive and webkit:
-----------------------
version: Taken from WebKit repo: r57734
source: 
svn checkout http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk@r57734 WebKit
how old? how far behind latest stable release?
-That revision dates to April 9th, 2010, which is about a year and a
 half older than the latest nightly build (webkit doesn't do
 releases).
-The latest revision number on the repo is past 100000.
how heavily modified?
-appears to be quite heavily modified, produces a >25000 line diff
why chosen?
-needed to replace aging bezillabrowser which was firefox2 based
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebPositive
-webkit backed by apple (safari) and google (chrome)

-latest stable release: 4.6.2, October 26th, 2011
how heavily modified?
-produces a 45,000 line diff from the source
why chosen?
-obviously need a compiler to make haiku self-hosting and for building
 ports
-for backwards compatibility with BeOS R5, the gcc2 C++ ABI is used to
 build Haiku libraries

gcc4:
-----
version: 4.4.4
source: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-4.4.4/
how old? how far behind latest stable release?
-4.4.4 was released on April 29th, 2010
-latest stable release: 4.6.2, October 26th, 2011
how heavily modified?

why chosen?
-obviously need a compiler to make haiku self-hosting and for building
 ports
-faster than gcc2 and produces more optimized code
