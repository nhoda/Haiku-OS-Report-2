A service that listens for system messages indicating new media has been detected and automatically mounts associated filesystems.

An application that provides one-stop access to file system exploration. Clicking the "Tracker" button brings up a list of all open windows currently viewing any mounted file systems.

Similar to the Windows task bar, its "Start" bar is instead a button with the Haiku feather. It behaves exactly as one would expect, bringing up menus that provide access to applications, shutdown/sleep functionality, recent documents, system preferences, and more.

Haiku initializes itself through a Bash shell script called Bootscript. The kernel calls upon this script directly when initializing applications and services when Haiku starts. Bootscript also calls upon a SetupEnvironment script that initializes important environment variables. Several applications are started when Haiku is initialized. Some of the important ones, in the order they are initialized, include:

This was all discovered through a fortunate accident, finding the Bootscript in its logical location, /boot/system/boot/. Several scripts are found in this directory, and a "more" on Bootscript revealed its importance in Haiku's boot process. A grep on kernel sources confirmed that Bootscript was indeed solely responsible for the order of application and service initialization in
